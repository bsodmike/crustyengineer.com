If we look at [one classic example][1] we know that computers are designed around 1's and 0's, hence the binary system, or base-2. This falls apart when looking at numbers such as `1/3` which evaluates to _0.333333333333333333333333333333333333_‚Ä¶ and so on until infinity. That‚Äôs right much like 1/10 in binary, 1/3 in decimal also does not have a finite representation and any attempt to store it in a computer using a decimal number will result in a loss of precision. Decimal can display more fractions precisely than binary can, but not all of them.

This is [why financial systems store the base value][6] in cents. However, computations over aggregate data invariably leads to fixed-point calculations.

## Semantic typing

We can use the `newtype` pattern (a.k.a [New Type Idiom](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html)) in Rust and introduce such a type into our codebase.

```rust
use fastnum::D128;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default)]
pub struct Amount<const DECIMALS: usize>(D128);

/// Semantic type to indicate the underlying value is in Euros and not [`Cents`].
type Euros = Amount<0>;

/// A monetary amount in cents (2 decimal places).
#[allow(dead_code)]
type Cents = Amount<2>;

impl<const DECIMALS: usize> Amount<DECIMALS> {
    pub const fn new_f64(inner: f64) -> Self {
        Self(D128::from_f64(inner))
    }
}

impl<const DECIMALS: usize> std::fmt::Display for Amount<DECIMALS> {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}

impl<const DECIMALS: usize> From<D128> for Amount<DECIMALS> {
    fn from(value: D128) -> Self {
        Self(value)
    }
}
```

In this example, we are formatting an aggregate value. The error here shows the high-precision of our [`D128`](https://docs.rs/fastnum/0.2.10/fastnum/decimal/type.D128.html) type.

```rs
// https://github.com/bsodmike/rust-scratch/tree/master/fixed_precision_calculations/src/ex_1_part_1.rs

#[should_panic(expected = "assertion `left == right` failed")]
#[test]
fn simulate_rounding_failure() {
   let average: f64 = 56098.9;
   let r: D128 = D128::from(average) / D128::from(100);

   assert_eq!(r.to_string(), "560.99");

   // thread 'ex_1_part_1::tests::simulate_rounding_failure' panicked at src/ex_1_part_1.rs:44:9:
   //     assertion `left == right` failed
   // left: "560.98900000000001455191522836685180664"
   // right: "560.99"
}

#[test]
fn simulate_rounding_failure_fixed() {
   let average: f64 = 56098.9;
   let r: D128 = D128::from(average) / D128::from(100);
   let r = r.round(2);

   assert_eq!(r.to_string(), "560.99");
}
```

We can leverage our semantic typing to reflect that the underlying value are Euros, or `Amount<0>`. Rounding is performed since we only care about 2 decimal places.

```rs
// https://github.com/bsodmike/rust-scratch/tree/master/fixed_precision_calculations/src/ex_1_part_1.rs

#[should_panic(expected = "assertion `left == right` failed")]
#[test]
fn simulate_rounding_failure_converted() {
   let average: f64 = 56098.9;
   let r: D128 = D128::from(average) / D128::from(100);
   // let r = r.round(2);
   let euros: Euros = r.into();

   assert_eq!(euros.to_string(), "560.99");
   //
   // thread 'ex_1_part_1::tests::simulate_rounding_failure_converted' panicked at src/ex_1_part_1.rs:68:9:
   //     assertion `left == right` failed
   // left: "560.98900000000001455191522836685180664"
   // right: "560.99"
}

#[test]
fn simulate_rounding_failure_converted_fixed() {
   let average: f64 = 56098.9;

   let r: D128 = D128::from(average) / D128::from(100);
   let euros: Euros = r.round(2).into();

   assert_eq!(euros.to_string(), "560.99");
}
```

## The `fastnum` crate

> Any `fastnum` decimal type consists of an N-bit big unsigned integer, paired with a 64-bit control block which contains a 16-bit scaling factor determines the position of the decimal point, sign, special, and signaling flags. Trailing zeros are preserved and may be exposed when in string form.

I also found a great quote from the author of `fastnum`:

> the primary purpose of this library ‚Äì to provide strictly accurate precision with no round-off errors, within the rules of the decimal number system. Naturally, it offers no particular advantage for general rational numbers. In fact, in any numeral system (e.g., base-2, base-10, or base-16), there will always be fractions that can't be represented with a finite number of digits.
>
> The key point is that working with decimal numbers follows intuitive rules familiar to everyone from school. For example, we all understand that 1/3 = 0.333333...(3) and that rounding is eventually inevitable. However, the fact that 0.1, when written down in a notebook, might turn into something like 0.10000000000001 in calculations ‚Äì puzzles many people, because in the real world, we neither interact with the binary number system nor write numbers in it.
