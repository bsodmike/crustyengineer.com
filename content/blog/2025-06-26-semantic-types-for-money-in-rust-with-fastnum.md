At the end of this article, I have added further reading material which cover the following topics:

- Why using floats for currencies is generally a bad idea. This is due to floats being a `base-2` (binary) number system, and will always lead to decimal rounding errors.
- Recommended approach is to store monetary values (currencies) as "cents" (or higher scaling as needed -- see examples for further details).

## Quick overview of the `fastnum` crate

Reasons as to why one would choose this particular crate:

- `fastnum` is a crate that implements fixed-precision calculations using fixed-point decimal arithmetic, which could be summarised succinctly as `coefficient / 10^exponent = 12345 / 100 = 123.45` for a `coefficient` of `12345` and `exponent` of `2`.
- the `fixed-precision` aspect of this crate makes it blazing fast, when compared to alternatives.
- The [codebase is only 8-months (new)](https://docs.rs/fastnum/0.2.10/fastnum/index.html) as of the time of typing and appears to be popular and well maintained on Github.
- Disclaimer: this is now a core dependency of a financial platform that I'm working on for a client. The codebase uses semantic types, and my work largely interacts with them. This article is inspired by this particular implementation.

From the author of `fastnum`:

> The key point is that working with decimal numbers follows intuitive rules familiar to everyone from school. For example, we all understand that 1/3 = 0.333333...(3) and that rounding is eventually inevitable. However, the fact that 0.1, when written down in a notebook, might turn into something like 0.10000000000001 in calculations ‚Äì puzzles many people, because in the real world, we neither interact with the binary number system nor write numbers in it.

He refers to the [classic example of this is 0.1 + 0.2 ‚â† 0.3][1]. Since the binary number system, `base-2` is the building block of logic, this falls apart when looking at numbers such as `1/3` which evaluates to _0.33333333333333_‚Ä¶ and so on until infinity. That‚Äôs right much like 1/10 in binary, 1/3 in decimal also does not have a finite representation and any attempt to store it in a computer using a decimal number will result in a loss of precision. Decimal can display more fractions precisely than binary can, but not all of them.

Here's another great write up, explaining why [financial systems store the base value][6] in cents:

> Because floats and doubles cannot accurately represent the base 10 multiples that we use for money. This issue isn't just for Java, it's for any programming language that uses base 2 floating-point types.
>
> In base 10, you can write 10.25 as 1025 _ 10-2 (an integer times a power of 10). IEEE-754 floating-point numbers are different, but a very simple way to think about them is to multiply by a power of two instead. For instance, you could be looking at 164 _ 2-4 (an integer times a power of two), which is also equal to 10.25. That's not how the numbers are represented in memory, but the math implications are the same.
>
> Even in base 10, this notation cannot accurately represent most simple fractions. For instance, you can't represent 1/3: the decimal representation is repeating (0.3333...), so there is no finite integer that you can multiply by a power of 10 to get 1/3. You could settle on a long sequence of 3's and a small exponent, like 333333333 \* 10-10, but it is not accurate: if you multiply that by 3, you won't get 1.
>
> However, for the purpose of counting money, at least for countries whose money is valued within an order of magnitude of the US dollar, usually all you need is to be able to store multiples of 10-2, so it doesn't really matter that 1/3 can't be represented.
>
> The problem with floats and doubles is that the vast majority of money-like numbers don't have an exact representation as an integer times a power of 2. In fact, the only multiples of 0.01 between 0 and 1 (which are significant when dealing with money because they're integer cents) that can be represented exactly as an IEEE-754 binary floating-point number are 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1. All the others are off by a small amount. As an analogy to the 0.333333 example, if you take the floating-point value for 0.01 and you multiply it by 10, you won't get 0.1. Instead you will get something like 0.099999999786...
>
> Representing money as a double or float will probably look good at first as the software rounds off the tiny errors, but as you perform more additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions on inexact numbers, errors will compound and you'll end up with values that are visibly not accurate. This makes floats and doubles inadequate for dealing with money, where perfect accuracy for multiples of base 10 powers is required.
>
> A solution that works in just about any language is to use integers instead, and count cents. For instance, 1025 would be $10.25. Several languages also have built-in types to deal with money

Let's cover our first topic.

## Semantic typing

We can use the `newtype` pattern (a.k.a [New Type Idiom](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html)) in Rust and introduce such a type into our codebase. It will be backed by [`D128`](https://docs.rs/fastnum/0.2.10/fastnum/decimal/type.D128.html) from the `fastnum` crate.

```rust
use fastnum::D128;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default)]
pub struct Amount<const DECIMALS: usize>(D128);

/// Semantic type to indicate the underlying value is in Euros and not [`Cents`].
type Euros = Amount<0>;

/// A monetary amount in cents (2 decimal places).
#[allow(dead_code)]
type Cents = Amount<2>;

/// A monetary amount in cents/100 (4 decimal places), or "1/10,000" - hence the name.
pub type Pertenthousand = Amount<4>;
```

Let's expand the interface for our `Amount<D>` type, starting with two methods.

- `new_scaled_i32` converts an `i32` value returning our `Amount<D>` type. From the example below, this is `1234/(10^2) = 12.34`
- `new_f64` creates a [`D128`](https://docs.rs/fastnum/0.2.10/fastnum/decimal/type.D128.html) value, just as it says on the tin.

```rust
impl<const DECIMALS: usize> Amount<DECIMALS> {
    /// Treats the input as a scaled integer (e.g. 1234 ‚Üí 12.34)
    pub const fn new_scaled_i32(inner: i32) -> Self {
        Self(D128::from_i32(inner).div(D128::from_i32(10_i32).pow(D128::from_usize(DECIMALS))))
    }

    pub const fn new_f64(inner: f64) -> Self {
        Self(D128::from_f64(inner))
    }
}
```

We can also format this value to a `String`, either directly

```rust
    #[test]
    fn convert_to_string() {
        // This is a whole currency unit
        let value = Amount::<0>::new_scaled_i32(1234);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);

        assert_eq!(formatted, "1234");

        let value = Amount::<2>::new_scaled_i32(1234);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);

        assert_eq!(formatted, "12.34");

        // We've increased our precision here, this is reflected in the formatted output
        let value = Amount::<4>::new_scaled_i32(123456);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);

        assert_eq!(formatted, "12.3456");
    }
```

or preferably via the types we introduced earlier. `Pertenthousand` is useful in financial systems, as seen in High-frequency Trading (HFT) platforms; notice that we no longer need to provide annotation to the compiler for the generic type `D` in `Amount<D>` as this is already specified via our semantic types.

```rust
    #[test]
    fn convert_to_string_via_semantic_types() {
        // This is a whole currency unit
        let value: Euros = Amount::new_scaled_i32(1234);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);
        assert_eq!(formatted, "1234");

        // monetary cents
        let value: Cents = Amount::new_scaled_i32(1234);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);
        assert_eq!(formatted, "12.34");

        // We've increased our precision here, this is reflected in the formatted output
        let value: Pertenthousand = Amount::new_scaled_i32(123456);
        let formatted = format!("{}", value);
        assert_eq!(formatted, "12.3456");
    }
```

We need to impl the `Display` trait for this to work

```rust
impl<const DECIMALS: usize> std::fmt::Display for Amount<DECIMALS> {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```
